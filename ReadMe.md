# A SCHEMA FOR PREDICTING STUDENTS' GRADUATION LIKELYHOOD  USING DATA MINING MODELS


* The purpose of this work is to use data mining model. The Project uses both supervised and unsupervised models to make prediction.*


## Introduction
This is a data science project that uses both regression and classification model to predict students' graduation. This was done using KMeans algorithm in order see into how many classes the students are classified and then Support Vector Machine was used to predicting students' graduation and finally used Linear regression to predict students' Performance.


## Dataset Source and Rows
two sets of different datasets were used one to predict students performance and the other one to predict students graduation. The data used were both from [KAGGLE](https://kaggle.com) and [UCI Repository](https://http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Student+Performance), both are free sources for datasets that are recognised by so many people in both academia and industry.
The performance datasets consists of 32 while for the students graduation/dropout data it includes more.


## Algorithms and Libraries

For the prediction part two algorithms were used which are Support Vector Machine and Linear Regression. These models were implemented using [Scikit learning] (https://https://scikit-learn.org/stable/). Other libraries used mostly during data analysis and data analysis and data cleaning includes:
 -Pandas: for importing data and cleaning. 
 -Numpy: for mathematical calculations.
 -Matplotlib: for data visualization.
 -Seaborn: for data visualizations also.
 and many others...



## Activities.
the entire project was classified into three activities namely:
-importing and cleaning data.
-data analysis.
-pipeline creation and
